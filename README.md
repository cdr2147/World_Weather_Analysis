# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
Assist in collecting and analyzing weather data across cities worldwide to help the app PlanMyTrip make recommendations of ideal hotels based on a client's weather preferences. After refactoring code to add the weather description to the weather data that was collected, beta testers used input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences and were presented with potential travel detisnations and nearby hotels. Beta testers could then choose four cities to create a travel intinerary and using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities and a marker map were presented to them. 
## Results
After entering weather preferences, beta testers were presented with a map with markers including the current weather description and nearby hotels to the cities that matched their preferences.

After beta testers picked four cities that were of interest, a travel direction map was generated in addition to providing a marker map for the four selected cities with current weather and nearby hotel.
